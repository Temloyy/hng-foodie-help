# FoodieHelp's Story for a Non-Technical Audience
## 📌 What FoodieHelp Does
Imagine going to a store to shop for groceries and you see a beetroot looking so fresh and then decide to add it to your cart, then you get home and literally have no idea what delicacy to make with it, and you know that within a few days this beetroot will go bad. You need a quick solution to this problem right? That's where FoodieHelp comes in. 

FoodieHelp allows you to search for that particular ingredient that you bought, in this case, the Beetroot, either just by typing the name in the search bar or by taking a picture of it. Then it gives you a list of meals or drinks that you can make with it and step-by-step instructions on how to make them. It doesn't end there, FoodieHelp can also help you to take a scan of other ingredients that you have in order to filter your search results to only meals that you can make with what you have, and of course, that is if you want that. 

FoodieHelp also does not restrict you to foods only available in a particular area, you have food recommendations across cultures, languages and regions, you are not restricted. Know what is more interesting? FoodieHelp also allows you to get voice guided step-by-step instructions if you would prefer that to reading the steps in the app, making you feel like you have a companion in the kitchen.
