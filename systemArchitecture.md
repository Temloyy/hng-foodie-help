FoodieHelp app system architecture breakdown

Overview
FoodieHelp app is a mobile application that helps users search for a particular hero ingredient or food item, either by text or by searching with their camera, giving the user a list of meals or consumables that can be made with the ingredient and step-by-step instructions with audio option. Users have access to group chats and smart pantry sync, giving them recommendations for recipes they can cook immediately.

The system is designed around a modular client-server architecture with integrated machine learning and data services.
The primary goal is to let users identify an ingredient (using their camera or by text) and instantly get contextual recipes, including voice guided cooking and pantry synchronization.
